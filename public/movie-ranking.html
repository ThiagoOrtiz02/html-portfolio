    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Cars</h3>
        <p>About a runner was superb and learned a great lesson in humility in life.</p>
    <h3>Pirates of the Caribbean 3</h3>
       <p>it is a visually impressive film, but its confusing plot and excessively long make the experience tiring and not very engaging for the        audience.  o</p>
    <h3>harry potter and the philosopher's stone</h3>
        <p> It's a moving and enchanting film that manages to capture the essence of the magical world created by J.K. Rowling. While it might be a little childish for some, the movie is a great adaptation of the book and an excellent starting point for the franchise.</p>
